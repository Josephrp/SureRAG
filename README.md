# SureRAG: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Content Creation

Welcome to the SureRAG repository, your go-to solution for automating and validating high-quality, engaging content with the power of AI. SureRAG combines advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Vectara's hallucination check mechanism (HHME) to ensure your content is not only compelling but also accurate and trustworthy. Ideal for businesses looking to enhance their online reputation through consistent, validated content publication on platforms like Twitter.

## Getting Started

This repository contains a simple `requirements.txt` for managing dependencies and an `app.py` file that launches a Gradio interface, making it incredibly user-friendly to interact with the SureRAG system.

cd SureRAG
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```

## How to Use SureRAG
- **Input Your Content Requirements:** Through the Gradio interface, input the topic or keywords related to the content you wish to generate.

- **Content Generation and Validation:** SureRAG utilizes Vectara's RAG retrieval, reranking, and summarization to source relevant content. It then generates engaging content based on these insights. Each piece undergoes a thorough check with Vectara's HHME to ensure accuracy and prevent misinformation.

- **Review and Publish:** The final step is to review the generated content. Once satisfied, you can directly publish to platforms like Twitter or use the content as needed for your business.

### Features
